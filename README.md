NetsBlox (client source code)

https://netsblox.org

An extension of Snap providing networking capabilities, collaborative editing and comprehensive undo/logging support.

For a deployment ready version of NetsBlox, check out the [main repo](https://github.com/netsblox/netsblox).

## Quick Start
If you need to make changes only to the client side of netsblox if it is a change that is generic and everyone could benefit from [fork us and make a pull request](https://github.com/NetsBlox/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/pulls).
Otherwise, you can always host the NetsBlox client and point it to our server. This way you can still:
1. communicate with other users on main NetsBlox server
2. use our server deployment so you don't have to setup and maintain your own
3. have access to all the services already available and configured on NetsBlox.

To host your own client files, first install dependencies:
```
cd utils/  
npm install
```
Next, the cloud client needs to be built:
```
cd src/cloud
npm install
npm run build
```

Then return to the project root and start the file server with
```
node utils/serve.js
```
